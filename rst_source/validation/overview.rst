Validation Overview
*******************

The **pwv_kpno** package was originally beta tested at Kitt Peak National
Observatory. During this period various investigations were performed to
validate not only the performance of the package, but the scientific results
as well. We present a limited subset of these results here. Please note
that these results should not be taken as a complete overview of our validation
process. It is instead meant to provide a basic overview of key points from
our investigation.

Much of the work shown here can be found in the **pwv_kpno** paper:
`Perrefort, Wood-Vasey et al. 2018 <https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.09701>`_.
Scientific questions concerning the package and its modeling capabilities are
welcomed, and can be submitted via GitHub (see the "Need Help?" link above) or
by email to the paper's primary author.

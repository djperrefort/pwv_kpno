Comparison to Observations
==========================

Observations of BD+262606 were taken using the R. C. Spectrograph at Kitt Peak
National Observatory. The top panel demonstrates the modeled PWV transmission
function at the time of observation (blue) smoothed by a gaussian kernel
(orange). The middle panel compares the observed spectra (red) divided by the
smoothed transmission model (blue). This is compared against the spectra
corrected using catalog values (green) multiplied by the smoothed transmission
(orange). Residuals between the catalog corrected and model corrected spectra
are shown in the bottom panel. Hydrogen alpha lines are highlighted in red and
O\ :sub:`2`\ lines in grey.

Residuals of PWV Models
=======================

Linear fits to measurements of precipitable water vapor column density taken at
four different locations versus simultaneous measurements taken at Kitt Peak.
Each row corresponds to a different location being compared against Kitt Peak,
with measurements shown on the left and binned residuals shown on the right.
The correlation in PWV column density between different sites allows the PWV
column density at Kitt Peak to be modeled using measurements from other
locations.

Quick Start
===========


Installation
------------

Using the `pip package manager <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/>`_ is the
recommended method for installing **pwv_kpno**. To install with pip, run:

.. code-block:: bash
   :linenos:

    pip install pwv_kpno

The pip package manager will automatically install any missing dependencies
in your Python environment. If you have any issues installing the package,
try installing the dependency manually and then reinstall **pwv_kpno**.
Dependencies can be installed with pip by running:

.. code-block:: bash
   :linenos:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

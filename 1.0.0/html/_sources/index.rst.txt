********
Overview
********

**pwv_kpno** is a Python package for modeling the atmospheric absorption due
to H\ :sub:`2`\ O at Kitt Peak National Observatory. It provides atmospheric
models from 300 to 1,200 nm for years 2010 onward. Understanding atmospheric
effects is important when calibrating ground based astronomical observations.
Astronomers traditionally calibrate broad-band imaging by using a reference
catalog to compute correction terms for color, airmass, and perhaps a
higher-order color-airmass term. **pwv_kpno** provides an alternative that can
be performed at the user's convenience.

Atmospheric absorption in the near-infrared is highly dependent on the column
density of precipitable water vapor (PWV). By measuring the delay of GPS
signals through the atmosphere, the `SuomiNet project
<http://www.suominet.ucar.edu>`_ provides accurate PWV measurements for
multiple, international locations. The **pwv_kpno** package uses published
SuomiNet data in conjunction with MODTRAN models to determine the modeled
atmospheric transmission function at Kitt Peak in close to real time. The
package also provides automated retrieval and processing of SuomiNet data,
allowing photometry to typically be corrected within an hour of observation.

pwv_kpno is open source software released under the GNU General Public License.
Issues raised on `GitHub <https://github.com/mwvgroup/pwv_kpno>`_ and pull
requests from contributors are welcome.

Comparing Seasonal Trends
=========================

Measurements of precipitable water vapor (PWV) from the SuomiNet project from
2010 onward. From top to bottom, SuomiNet measurements for Kitt Peak National
Observatory, Sahuarita AZ, and Tucson AZ (Blue). The modeled PWV level at Kitt
peak is shown in Orange. Periods of one day or longer where there are no
modeled PWV values are shown in grey. The geographic proximity of these
locations means that the primary difference in PWV between locations is due to
differences in altitude. Measurements taken at Kitt Peak National Observatory
begin in March of 2015.

Residuals of PWV Models
=======================

Linear fits to measurements of precipitable water vapor column density taken at
four different locations versus simultaneous measurements taken at Kitt Peak.
Each row corresponds to a different location being compared against Kitt Peak,
with measurements shown on the left and binned residuals shown on the right.
The correlation in PWV column density between different sites allows the PWV
column density at Kitt Peak to be modeled using measurements from other
locations.

Validation Overview
*******************

The **pwv_kpno** package was originally beta tested for Kitt Peak National
Observatory. During this period various investigations were performed to
validate not only the performance of the package, but the scientific results
as well. We present a limited subset of these results here. While this does not 
provide a complete overview of our validation process, it does overview key
points from our investigation.

Much of the work shown here can be found in the **pwv_kpno** paper:
`Perrefort, Wood-Vasey et al. 2018 <https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.09701>`_.
Scientific questions concerning the package and its modeling capabilities are
welcomed and can be submitted via GitHub (see the "Need Help?" link above) or
by email to the paper's primary author.

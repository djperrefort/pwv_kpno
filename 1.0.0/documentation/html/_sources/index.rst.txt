What is pwv_kpno?
=================

**pwv_kpno** is a scientific Python package that provides models for the
atmospheric transmission due to precipitable water vapor (PWV) at user
specified sites. By measuring the delay of dual-band GPS signals traveling
through the atmosphere, it is possible to determine the PWV column density
along the line of sight. **pwv_kpno** leverages this principle to provide
atmospheric models for user definable sites as a function of date,
time, and airmass. Using the package, ground-based photometric observations
taken between 3,000 and 12,000 AÌŠ can be easily corrected for atmospheric
effects due to PWV.

How it Works
============

The SuomiNet project is a meteorological initiative that provides semi-hourly
PWV measurements for hundreds of GPS receivers worldwide. The **pwv_kpno**
package uses published SuomiNet data in conjunction with MODTRAN models to
determine the modeled, time-dependent atmospheric transmission.
By default, the package provides access to the modeled transmission
function at Kitt Peak National Observatory. However, the package is designed
to be easily extensible to other locations within the SuomiNet Network.
Additionally, **pwv_kpno** provides access to atmospheric models as a function
of PWV, which is independent of geographical location.
